# Modern Cloud Based Academic Inventory System

This inventory system supplements the existing inventory system used by the Russ College of Engineering and Technology to track hardware as mandated by Ohio University. We use a Bluetooth RFID scanner (**TSL 1128 Bluetooth UHF RFID Reader**) paired with an Android smartphone to read RFID tags on inventory items and then look up these items by the tag number in a realtime database, provided by Firebase.

Each entry contains:

* An image
* The name of the item
* The serial number
* RFID tag color
* The original price
* The last known location
* A brief description
* If the item was sent to surplus or other (lost, stolen, etc)
* The last scanned date and historical data

Artifacts such as the Agile Sprint Presentations, along with the software's Requirements Specifications Document and Design Document, can be found in the Wiki section of this GitHub repository.
